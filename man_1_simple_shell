General Bark is a shell on top of the Kernal, hence the title general. Its task is to wrap around the Kernal and make interaction more civil, hence the name Bark, like the tree bark. The general takes most of the basics of commands that are present in the bash shell and communicate them to the Kernal in a soldierly manner. This is shell is built as part of a learning C.

General works like the bash and other basic C shells, though it has some to be yet build features.

ls -a
 . .. other_files
